## This repository is just a tweak of https://github.com/Source2ZE/CS2Fixes/
Removing "unnecessary" features from the original addon, to have the minimum to just run the commands.

## DISCLAIMER: *not* responsible for any issues or breakages caused by the plugin. 

# Competitive Practice & Scrim for CS2
This plugin adds the minimum requirements for competitive teams that need a more handy way of managing a few commands from the server side, like config management or replay recording.

## Available Commands

* Config and server management (Admin only)  
  `.pracc`: launch the practice config  
  `.scrim`: start the competitive match  
  `.map <map>`: change the map (example: `.map ancient`)  

* Scrim commands  
  `.pause`: pauses the match  
  `.unpause`: request the unpause  
  * Admin only  
    `.record`: start the demo recording  
    `.stoprecord`: finish the recording and save it under `gotv/<date>.dem`  
    `.restore <round>`: load the desired round's backup  
    `.forceunpause`: force the unpause
