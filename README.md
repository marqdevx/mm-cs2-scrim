### Fix server crashes
In case you have non-expected server crashes, it might be due the `addons\cs2scrim\gamedata\cs2fixes.games.txt` is not up-to-date.
I might not update that text until a next "official" release of the addon, so in order to fix that file:
Copy the content of the file https://github.com/marqdevx/mm-cs2-scrim/blob/main/gamedata/cs2fixes.games.txt onto your `addons\cs2scrim\gamedata\cs2fixes.games.txt`

# Addon information
This plugin adds the minimum requirements for competitive teams that need a more handy way of managing a few commands from the server side, like config management or replay recording.

The plugin has been developed with these ideas in mind:
1. Minimum impact on the server performance
2. Built for competitive teams to practice (not for tournaments)

## Available Commands

* Config and server management (Admin only)  
  `.pracc`: launch the practice config  
  `.scrim`: start the competitive match  
  `.map <map>`: change the map (example: `.map ancient`)  
  `.rcon <command>`: workaround to be used as the old rcon, execute commands from server side. Usage on the console `c_rcon <comnand>`  

* Scrim commands  
  `.pause`: pauses the match  
  `.unpause`: request the unpause  
  * Coach  
    `.coach`: switch to coach, also available `.coach <ct/t>`  
    `.uncoach`: return as a player  
  * Admin only  
    `.record`: start the demo recording  
    `.stoprecord`: finish the recording and save it under `gotv/<date_time_map>.dem` example: `gotv/03March_20-08_de_anubis.dem`  
    `.restore <round>`: load the desired round's backup  
    `.forceunpause`: force the unpause  

* Practice commands  
    `.spawn`: move to the desired competitive spawn i.e `.spawn 2` or `.spawn 1 ct`  
    `.last`: teleports to your latest thrown grenade lineup  
    `.noflash`: toggle flash effect  
    `.ct`, `.t`, `.spec`, `.side`: switch team side  

* Leveraged from [CS2Fixes](https://github.com/Source2ZE/CS2Fixes/)  
  `c_reload_admins`: console command to reload admins.cfg  
  `.ban <player> <duration/0 (permanent)>`: ban a player  
  `.unban <player>`: remove ban of player  
  `.kick <player>`: kick a player out of the server  
  `.gag <player> <duration>`: forbids chat to player  
  `.ungag <player>`: allow back a player that was gagged to chat  
  `.slay <player>`: kills a player  
  `.noclip`: toggles noclip to current player (practice mode)
