### Fix server crashes
In case you have non-expected server crashes, it might be due the `addons\cs2scrim\gamedata\cs2fixes.games.txt` is not up-to-date.
I might not update that text until a next "official" release of the addon, so in order to fix that file:
The original addon repository it's actively updated, so copy the content of this https://github.com/Source2ZE/CS2Fixes/blob/main/gamedata/cs2fixes.games.txt onto your `addons\cs2scrim\gamedata\cs2fixes.games.txt`
